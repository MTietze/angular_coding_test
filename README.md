# NBA DRAFT
### Angular 1.x Code Challenge



This is a simple excersize in which you will create a small app that allows you to select college basketball players and assign them to the nba teams of your choice. 

You will be given a list of the first ten teams that won the lottery for the draft. The list will be in JSON format.

You will also be given a list of the top prospective nba players that will be the first ten draft pics. This list will also be in JSON format

## Rules
- Your interface should have a drop down for the teams and a dropdown for the players.
- One should be selected from each list and then the place button should be pressed which adds the player and his team to a final selection roster.
- As the players are selected and the team is selected they should be removed from each list as the selection is complete. 
- When all the players have been placed on teams. a continue button should appear that takes you to the page that has the final roster.
- All data should be injected into the controllers through services.

## Extra Credit 
write a unit test for the services that ensures data is available
